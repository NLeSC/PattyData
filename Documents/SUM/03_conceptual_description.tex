\section{Conceptual description} \label{sec:concept_descr}

The gathered data use in the ViaAppia project represents the surface of an area
corresponding to one mile of the ancient Via Appia in Rome. Conceptually the
data is divided into road data (also referred as the {\em background}) and
context and monument data (also referred as {\em sites}). The {\em background}
data serves as a reference system. The {\em sites} data represents the objects
of interest and it is aligned with the {\em background}.

The data, depending on the way of acquisition, is of several types:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\em Point clouds (PC)}
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item A low resolution PC of the research area that has been generated making
    use of Fugro's DRIVE-MAP services.
    \item High resolution PCs of the different objects of interest (monuments,
    sites) generated using photogrammetric technologies.
    \end{itemize}
\item {\em Meshes} (sites reconstructions) for different historical epochs.
\item Contemporary and historical {\em pictures} or paintings.
\item {\em Attributes} data for the sites and their parts, which are gathered
by field observations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Point clouds}
Using the DRIVE-MAP service of Fugro the part of the
surface of the Via Appia between the fifth and sixth miles was scanned and a
{\em PC} was produced. A point in the PC has 4D coordinates ($x, y, z$), in
respect to a given Earth reference system known at scanning time, color and
possibly other measured attributes. The resolution (number of points per area
or volume) of this point cloud is not enough to see detailed features of the
sites, furthermore, they were only scanned from the main road. Thus, the back
of the sites is missing. This is illustrated on Fig.\ref{fig:viaAppiaPointCloud}.

\caption{Point cloud data gathered along Via Appia. The Drive map is of low
resolution and covers only part of the monuments (sites) facing the road.}
\label{fig:viaAppiaPointCloud} \end{figure}

Despite the existence of multiple drive-maps, obtained at different times or
with different acquisition devices, only one drive-map at a time is used as
background. It is also possible to have different versions of the same drive-map.
Each version contains post-processing results. For example, points classification,
e.g., sky, tree, road, etc., and non-interesting points filtering, e.g., tree and
grass removal.

Additional point clouds of higher resolution covering also the back of the
monuments have been obtained using photogrammetric software from photographic
pictures of the sites from different camera locations (viewpoints). Such data
is an addition to the {\em sites} data set.

\subsection{Pictures}
The pictures of a site are both contemporary (current) or historical pictures
or paintings. Fig.\ref{fig:viaAppiaMeshPicture} has an illustration of visualizing
a contemporary photo of a monument next to its point cloud data. The photo was
one of the photos used to generate the high resolution site PC and visualizing
it next to the location of the monument provides extra information about the
context. Each site has multiple pictures.

\subsection{Meshes}
For the purpose of archaeological research, multiple reconstructions of the
sites of interest are often performed. These reconstructions, or meshes, are
also classified as current or historical. An illustration of visualizing a
contemporary mesh of a monument aligned to its point cloud data is pictured
on Fig.\ref{fig:viaAppiaMeshPicture}.

cloud data.} \label{fig:viaAppiaMeshPicture} \end{figure}

The point clouds, meshes and pictures are stored according to the data
structure convention (Section \ref{sec:data_structure}).

\subsection {Attributes}
Attributes represents the data collected at the site by the archaeologists, 
for example, material composition, condition, possible interpretation,
description of the different elements or sub-parts, etc. The attribute data
is considered as additional descriptive (meta) data and it is stored in a
database along with the pointers to the other data types (Section
\ref{sec:database}). Furthermore, they extremely relevant for the definition
of archaeological research questions.
