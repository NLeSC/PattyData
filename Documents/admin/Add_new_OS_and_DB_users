Instructions on how to add users in the OS and the DB
*****************************************************

Add OS user
-----------
0 - Become root
sudo su
1 - Decide new user name. We use [first name][first letter of surname]. Example Oscar Martinez would be oscarm
2 - Issue the useradd command to create a locked user account:
useradd <username>
3 - Unlock the account by issuing the passwd command to assign a password (set a temporal password, later we have to tell new user to change password):
passwd <username>

Create SSH key for new user
--------------------------
4 - Become new user
su <username>
5 - Create a key pair:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Press Enter three times to use the default configuration (Important: Do not provide a
passphrase).
6 - Add the public key to the authorized keys:
cat  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
7 - Change permissions to the .ssh directory and its contents:
chmod 700  ~/.ssh/
chmod 600  ~/.ssh/*

Create DB user
--------------
8 - Connect to the DB with a user that has admin rights in the DB (root is not an option!)
psql <dbname>
9 - Create user 
create role <username> CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
10 - Grant connect to the desired DB:
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <dbname> to <username>;
11 - Grant usage on everything on public (all tables) to user
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>;
12 - In addition we must "GRANT SELECT ON TO public" to all the tables of the DB
     And "GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON TO public" to the tables that can be updated by everybody

[[[To drop the user
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA PUBLIC FROM <username>;
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE <dbname> FROM <username>;
drop role <username>;
]]]

13 - Mail to new user about new OS and DB account and tell him to change passwords asap. 
     Also inform of ZIP file and need to download private key (use wincsp)

# Connect to Via Appia server
ssh <username>@148.251.106.132

# Update OS pssword
passwd

#Update PostgreSQL password
psql <dbname> -c "alter user <username> WITH PASSWORD '<apasswordofyourchoice>';"
