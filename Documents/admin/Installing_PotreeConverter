Potree Converter build instructions
=======================================

We are using a potree converter tweaked to be able to specify the bounding cube used for the OctTree generation

git clone -b fix_fstream https://github.com/oscarmartinezrubi/PotreeConverter.git

In addition to liblas and its requirements (proj, tiff, geotiff, gdal and laszip) we also need boost 1.55

For installing liblas and its dependencies as well as boost 1.55 we recommend looking at https://github.com/NLeSC/pointcloud-benchmark/tree/master/install for different methods of installing liblas (and other point cloud related software) in different OSs
 Assuming the code is downloaded in /opt/PotreeConverter/
cd /opt/PotreeConverter/
mkdir build
mkdir makefiles 
cd makefiles
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/PotreeConverter/build -DBoost_DIR=/opt/boost_1_55_0/build -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/boost_1_55_0/build/include -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIRS=/opt/boost_1_55_0/build/include -DBoost_LIBRARY_DIRS=/opt/boost_1_55_0/build/lib -DLIBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/liblas/build/include -DLIBLAS_LIBRARY=/opt/liblas/build/lib/liblas.so
make 
make install

Possible issues
---------------

There are a couple of issues that may arise with the installation of PotreeConverter

1 - The specified boost is ignored. In order to force the a certain version of Boost we modify the CMakeLists.txt 

find_package(Boost 1.55.0 COMPONENTS system thread filesystem program_options regex REQUIRED)

2 - We need to add #include <limits> in PotreeConverter/include/AABB.h

3 - If it compaing about the CPLMutexHolder it means that GDAL is not found by the linker. To solve this you need to make sure that the next environmental variables are set before run the cmake command:

export LIBLAS_HOME=/home/oscar/sw/liblas/build
export LASZIP_HOME=/home/oscar/sw/laszip-2.1.0/build
export BOOST_HOME=/usr/local
export GDAL_HOME=/home/oscar/sw/gdal-trunk/build
export CWD_HOME=`pwd`
export BOOST_ROOT=$BOOST_HOME
export CMAKE_MODULE_PATH=$LIBLAS_HOME:${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}
export LD_RUN_PATH=$GDAL_HOME/lib:$BOOST_HOME/lib:$LASZIP_HOME/lib:$LIBLAS_HOME/lib:$CWD_HOME/lib:$LD_RUN_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GDAL_HOME/lib:$BOOST_HOME/lib:$LASZIP_HOME/lib:$LIBLAS_HOME/lib:$CWD_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$GDAL_HOME/lib:$BOOST_HOME/lib:$LASZIP_HOME/lib:$LIBLAS_HOME/lib:$CWD_HOME/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$LIBLAS_HOME/include/liblas/capi:${C_INCLUDE_PATH}
export LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L$GDAL_HOME/lib -L$BOOST_HOME/lib -L$LIBLAS_HOME/lib -L$LASZIP_HOME/lib -llas_c -llaszip"

4 - Current version may not be compiling (it does not at date 25/05/2015). There is some issue with fstream that can be fixed using the branch fix_fstream as proposed before. If you get this message be sure that you used this branch
