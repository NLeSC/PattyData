Point cloud visualization/ query system using database backend.

This document describes the alternative system for point cloud visualization and querying using point clouds and their semantics stored in a database system.

Components:
1. database system storing the point cloud representations created by the POTree converter;

2. web-server for dynamic content. The server receives the URL requests from the POTree viewer and translates them into database queries to extract the requested .js/ .las/ .laz files, and returns the responce to the viewer.

Step 1: set-up the database server
**********************************

1.1 Install PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension

1.2 Create database and user

1.3 Create the database schema from file ERDB.sql
	psql -U postgres < ERDB.sql

1.4 Populate the database with the data from the converter using the python script populate.py


Step2: set-up the web-server
****************************
Use the python script xxx.py
